# Honey Bee Health Detection
The model helps in classifying Honey bee health for intelligent hive monitoring.

◦ Built a CNN model to predict and classify the health of bees. The model classifies the bees’ health into
various categories like healthy/ hive being robbed/ ant problems/ hive beetles etc and helps in intelligent
hive monitoring.

◦ The project involved the use of Keras: the python deep learning API, and various other python libraries
like scipy, pandas, numpy and matplotlib etc.

◦ Trained the model on ”BeeImage” dataset and achieved an accuracy of :

◦ Learnings: Image features extraction using Convolutional neural networks, Keras API, Gradient
Descent, Backpropagation.
